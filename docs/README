Initialization Hooks
====================

The inithooks package provides execution of firstboot and everyboot
scripts. It was designed to be as generic and barebones as possible,
leaving the functionality up to the hook scripts.

In a nutshell, it will execute scripts in alpha-numeric ordering located
in predetermined paths. The firstboot scripts will only be executed
if a flag is set. Once the firstboot scripts are executed successfully,
the flag will be unset and those scripts will not be executed again.

The init script is executed quite early on in system initialization, at
runlevel 2 15, as to enable configuration of the system prior to most
services starting. This should be taken into consideration when
developing hook scripts.

/etc/default/inithooks

    INITHOOKS_CONF=/etc/inithooks.conf
    INITHOOKS_PATH=/usr/lib/inithooks
    RUN_FIRSTBOOT=true

So, the default firstboot and everyboot paths would be:

    /usr/lib/inithooks/firstboot.d/
    /usr/lib/inithooks/everyboot.d/

RUN_FIRSTBOOT is the flag (obviously).

Enjoy!
