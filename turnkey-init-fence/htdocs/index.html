<title>Please initialize this system</title>
<body>

You need to initialize this appliance first before you can use it. To do
that you'll need to log in as root. The initialization program will
start automatically. You can log in using the <script type="text/javascript">
    document.write("<a href='https://" + document.domain + ":12320/'>web shell</a>")
</script> or using a native SSH client (e.g., Putty on Windows).

<p>If you haven't setup SSH key authentication, you'll need to get the
random root password from the EC2 console. It's printed at the bottom so
please scroll all the way down.  <p>

For further information regarding this appliance, please consult the <a
